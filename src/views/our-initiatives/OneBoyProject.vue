              This project seeks to EDUCATE one Boy at a time. This sponsorship programme would focus on Boys across different cities in Africa. Boys whose family arenâ€™t financial able to foot the basic education bills or do not have immediate access to education in their area.
            </p>

              This falls under the SDG Goal 4 - Quality Education.
