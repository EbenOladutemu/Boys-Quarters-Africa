        <p> 
          The principal objective of this Pillar of Impact is to detox the minds of every Boy of the <i>‘Stereotyped
          Masculine Leadership’</i> and the damaging toxic masculinity that is subconsciously passed on. The sheer
          feeling that Men are made to lead and Women are made to follow birth the spiral disease called
          ‘Misogyny’ in our society.
        </p>
        <p>
          On this Pillar of impact, we engage Boys by teaching them that Leadership is Service and not about the
          Sex or Gender. Leadership isn’t synonymous to being a Boy or a Man. Leadership isn’t about the innate
          aspiration for office.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Boys Quarters, we believe if our Boys are taught right, their perception of women and familyhood
          would take a positive turn. In our bid to change the narrative around Gender Equality & Human Right,
          there’s a need to tweak the inherited understanding of what leadership means to our Boys.
        </p>
        <h3>Projects</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Leadership 101 for Boys</b> – This is an unpublished book. The goal is to have this book in the hand of
            every Boy-Child by the end of 2030. This transformational book will help Boys see Leadership as
            influence from every little action and inaction they take.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Men.Start.Action Project</b>- On this Project, Boys are rallied to raise funds for the procurement of
            Menstrual Pads for Girls in their locality. They raise the funds and go ahead to present these pads to
            them on a need basis, especially for Girls in rural area. This helps the Boys see a different narrative and
            instill in them the discipline to protect girls and women.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>The Boys Talk</b> – This is billed to be the largest Boys-Only conference in world. The goal is to have
            Men share their Success stories, struggles stories and experiences with the Boys. This ted-like session
            exposes the mind of the Boys what leading oneself can do.
